# YOLO Playground
---

Welcome to my YOLO Playground! You can fork this repo and use it for some experimentation with different kinds of blocks in `torch`. I've coded up some handy architecture to conduct meaningful ablation tests for your own personal studies, which I hope you'll find useful. I use this repository for a couple of things :

- conducting ablation studies
- implementing research paper concepts and testing the results.
- having fun !
